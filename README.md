# ACpowermeterusingamicrocontroller-ESP-32
In this semester project i made an AC-power meter using a microcontroller and displayed it on a 16*2 LCD
For the coding i used the emon.lib library in audrino IDE
This library has formulas for power measurments already defined, one can use the calibration factor to fine tune output values of AC current and voltage.
there is a ccp file or txt file included to understant emon.lib library 
there is a project report that can be used to understand whats happening.
